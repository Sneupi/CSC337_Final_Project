        <ul> 
            <li> Login Page </li>
                <p> Our login page is your chance to create your 
                    username and login to whatever webpage you want.
                    If for some reason you can't login to any chat
                    room, it's probably because your username has 
                    already been taken.
                </p>
            <li> ChatRoom </li>
                <p> Within our actual chat rooms you can see who's in the 
                    chat as well as what chat room you're in. To submit a 
                    message, just click on the textbox below and type in a 
                    chat to showcase to the world. If you're done with a room
                    just click on the home button on the left bottom side of 
                    the screen or to our chat room button to see what other 
                    chats are available.
                </p>
            <li> Chat List Room </li>
                <p> In the chat list room, you'll be able to see any open
                    rooms either created by you or by others. Simply click 
                    on one you would like to join and you will be redirected
                    to that chat room. 
        </ul>
