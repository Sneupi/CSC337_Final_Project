When deploying remotely, the server fails to send cookies 
back to the user after creating the sessionId on the server-side, 
effectively rendering the user unable access their sessionId and
chats despite successful login. This was not solved by the time we had to submit.

A valid cookie can be set manually via browser Application cookie 
storage as variable "sessionId" and the site begins to work again.

Here's a list of valid cookies to use to actually use the site.
(Sorry for the inconvenience)
